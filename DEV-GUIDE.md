Development guide
=================

Correctness over performance
----------------------------

Follow the CPython semantics as closely as possible

Dont generate source code from script
-------------------------------------

This rule is quite related to the history of jython code base, there used to be
a huge amount of generated code, namely *Derived.java, besically templates that
invoke method dynamically if the current type is derived from native type.

There are also (still exist) a lot of generated code for `VisitProc`, which
simulates the cycle garbage detector (I guess).

It's OK to generate bytecode, like the `codegen` tool, because they don't
pollute the source code, source code generated by script are generally low
effort solution and they are super hard to get rid of.

Code style
----------

* Follow java identifier convention, e.g. use numPool instead of num_pool
* When implementing python method, use java method name and alias by annotion
e.g.

```java
@ExposedMethod(names = {"__reduce__"})
public PyObject reduce() {
...
```
